Welcome to my Github profile!  I have no clue why you're here but welcome anyways.

Here's some random bullet points they have suggested as topics people who like to read Github profile might be interested in:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently on vacation! Previously, I worked at Splice, Omada Health & LegitScript as a principal backend engineer.
- ðŸ’© I'm currently learning about databases and re-learning Ruby!  Previously, I used Golang, Ruby, Rails and J@v@Script.  I don't think you want me coding in J@v@Script at this point so I'm going to change some letters to sneakily prevent scrapers from spamming me to death about J@v@Script.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently (and always) a big fan of [exercism.io](https://exercism.io/).
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
