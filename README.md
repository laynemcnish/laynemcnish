Welcome to my Github profile!  I have no clue why you're here but welcome anyways.

Here's some random bullet points they have suggested as topics people who like to read Github profile might be interested in:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at [github.com/splice](Splice) as the technical lead & senior backend engineer for our marketplace catalog, merchandising, and taxonomy services.  Previously, I was at Omada Health & LegitScript.
- ðŸ’© I'm currently coding with Golang!  Previously, I used Ruby, Rails and J@v@Script.  I don't think you want me coding in J@v@Script at this point so I'm going to change some letters to sneakily prevent scrapers from spamming me to death about J@v@Script.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently a big fan of [exercism.io](https://exercism.io/), [GoBridge's mentorship program](https://promo.qooper.io/organizations/MjE1) and [Sailor HG's](https://shop.bubblesort.io/) [FairyFloss Theme](http://sailorhg.github.io/fairyfloss/).
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about the best carbs for each major US city.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
