Welcome!

Here's some random bullet points they have suggested as topics people who like to read Github profile might be interested in:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently on vacation but soon will be looking for a new role as an engineering manager, team lead, or staff software engineer! Previously, I worked at Bandcamp / Epic Games, Splice, Omada Health & LegitScript as a principal backend engineer and tech lead.
- ðŸ’© I've mostly used Golang, Ruby, Rails and J@v@Script professionally.  I would prefer to not code fulltime in J@v@Script so I'm going to change some letters to sneakily prevent scrapers from spamming me to death about J@v@Script.  No offense, J@v@Script but I prefer backend over frontend these days.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently (and always) a big fan of [exercism.io](https://exercism.io/).
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her

If you think you have the perfect role for me, send me an email at laynemcnish@gmail.com
